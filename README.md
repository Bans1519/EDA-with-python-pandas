Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data-centric project, as it allows us to understand the underlying structure of the data and derive insights that can inform further analysis and modeling. Hereâ€™s an overview of an EDA project using Python in a Jupyter Notebook

Tools and Libraries:

Python: Python is the primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis. 

Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment for running Python code and documenting the analysis process.

Libraries: Key libraries such as Pandas (for data manipulation), Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization), and NumPy (for numerical operations) are utilized.
